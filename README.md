# Institutional Cyberinfrastructure Training Center in a Box

The [Doane Center for Computing in the Liberal Arts (CCLA)](https://web.doane.edu/colleges-divisions-programs/institute-for-computing/center-computing-liberal-arts) provides a collaborative and supportive learning environment for computing, staffed by a knowledgeable team, and is available to all students, faculty and staff at Doane University.  The CCLA helps individuals from any discipline learn how to best utilize computing resources to accomplish their goals in research, life, or just for fun. Our operating analogy is that the CCLA is like a campus writing center, but for computing instead of prose. 

This repository contains materials we have developed for the CCLA, that you can use to start your very own version of the center. In the repository you will find materials regarding:

* advertising advertising the center, to build awareness, increase visibility, and build a campus-wide culture of computing, 
* recruiting and training peer consultants (PCs) to staff the center, and
* managing PCs once they are on board

More materials developed by the CCLA, including on-line workshops, cyberinfrastructure course modules, and a curated collection of large datasets and problems usable by students working with advanced cyberinfrastructure tools, can be found at the [CCLA stie](https://web.doane.edu/colleges-divisions-programs/institute-for-computing/center-computing-liberal-arts).
